# GUT FLORA
this is a book i wrote. this repository holds the files and programs i used to generate the final copies of the book as well as some other versions which generate specific elements for a single pdf version for gumroad etc... maybe eventually this will hold code used to generate new copies using a node or something. idk! depends on where i want to use my energy!

please don't publish or reuse the writing or this code without attribution (and preferably permission). just send me an email or a tweet or something to let me know ok! use a link to my main website or something for attribution i guess. this is called "Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International" under by creative commons so this is what i am using.
