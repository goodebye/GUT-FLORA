# GUT FLORA
this is a book i wrote. this repository holds the files and programs i used to generate the final copies of the book. its a huge mess rn! maybe i will tidy in the future but this exists just for ppl who Really Really want to understand what im doing and because i think transparency in artistic process, esp. when tech is involved, can help ppl who want to do things but feel afraid b/c everyone is being so secretive w/ techniques
